# Terminal Colors

If your terminal supports it (xterm and lxterminal definitely work), sdm changes the terminal colors when providing a command prompt in Phase 1, or when using the `--mount` command, to remind you that things are not quite "normal".

The colors used by --explore are controlled by the `--ecolors` command switch, which takes an argument specified as 3 colors. The default is `--ecolors blue:gray:red` which sets the foreground (text) blue, the background gray, and the cursor red.

The colors for the `--mount` command are controlled by the `--mcolors` switch; the default is `--mcolors black:LightSalmon1:blue`.
