# Known Issues

* sdm must be run as root or with `sudo`
* sdm has been thoroughly tested on RasPiOS Bullsye and Buster 32-bit and 64-bit Desktop and Lite IMG files. It has been moderately, but not recently, tested on Raspbian Stretch IMG files, but obviously functions added to raspi-config in Bullseye or Buster are not supported on Stretch.
